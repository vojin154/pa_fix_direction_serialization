  Prison Architect - Fix Prison Directions Not Saving
</h1>

This mod is for the game Prison Architect. It aims to fix staff and prisoner directions not saving properly, resulting in losing them on save load.

I didn't run into any issues during testing, so it should work fine. If you however do end up having any problems, don't be shy and share them, and in-case you know the answer to said problem, why not pull request a fix?

## Installation

- Download the latest version under the releases section.
- Then simply extract the .DLL and drop it in your games folder.

**STEAM:**
  - Open your Steam Library and find Prison Architect there. Right click on it and select properties.
  - In the properties menu, go to the Files tab and click on Browse.
  - That will open the games root folder, it should contain `Prison Architect64.exe`, which is where you drop the extracted .DLL.

The .DLL wasn't made for other versions, and thus might not be compatible.

## Make your own version

1. You should be able to either press the green button saying "Code" and press Download ZIP. Obviously a different way if you have your own.
2. After that you normally extract the files and voilà! You have successfully cloned the project.
3. Open the .sln file using Visual Studio (Latest recommended).
4. Once you have made your changes and are ready to test, then just simply go to "Build" on top of the window and either click "Build Source" or "Build Solution". Both options are completely same, unless you have changed them yourself, which I assume you know the difference if you do.
5. If the build was successfull, then in the location where your .sln file is, you now have a new folder called "Compiled". Open it, then folder "Files" and there's your .DLL, which you can now put into your games folder!
